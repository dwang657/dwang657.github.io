The other day, I saw a police officer riding a horse, and I realized just how big horses are, so I created this web page to 
give some information on the largest horse breed: The Shire Horse. The page has four sections, which include an introduction, 
a section describing the characteristics of the breed, a section explaining its role in history, and a final section explaining
its role in society today.

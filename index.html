            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Shire horse is a British breed of draught horse. It is usually black, bay, or grey. Shires are known for their 
                great size and strength and have at various times held world records both for the largest horse and for the tallest 
                horse. The breed was developed in England for heavy farm and industrial work, and although its popularity declined 
                with the advent of mechanization, it has since become a popular breed for pulling heavy loads and in competitive and 
                leisure carriage driving.

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Shire horse has a rich history, dating back to the medieval times when they were used as war horses. Over time, 
                they were bred for their strength and size to be used as draught horses, capable of pulling heavy loads in industries 
                such as agriculture, transportation, and breweries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Shires were in high 
                demand, but their numbers dwindled after World War II due to mechanization. Today, efforts have been made to preserve 
                the breed, and they are used in promotional events, forestry, and as show horses.

            <h2>Use Today</h2>
            <p>Today, Shire horses are used primarily for leisure and promotional purposes. They participate in shows, parades, and 
                competitions. Some are still used in traditional roles such as logging and farming, where machinery is less suitable.
